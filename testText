Hello, walter. It is me, Nolan. I am writing to you from Regents Hall of Natural Science, Room 160R. Are you recieving this message?

Yes I am receiving this message. I love screaming at my computer. It is my favorite past time. 

I will attack Walter Fenske on sight. There is no question. There is a deep blood fueled rage within my soul.
